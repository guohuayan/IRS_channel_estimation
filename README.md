## IRS channel estimation

This repository contains the source codes of the paper ``Cascaded Channel Estimation for Intelligent Reflecting Surface Assisted Multiuser MISO Systems'' which is under review.

The source code will be updated soon when the paper is accepted.

In the paper, we propose a novel channel estimation protocol without the need of on-off amplitude control to avoid the reflection power loss. The protocol can work when the IRS element number is larger than the BS antenna number, while the existing works cannot do this with the same pilot overhead and without shutting down any IRS elements. 

In addition, we propose an optimization-based channel estimation algorithm which exploits the statistical CSI of the cascaded channel, while existing related works require the statistical CSI of the individual BS-IRS channel and IRS-user channel. Note that the statistical CSI of the individual channels is diffcult to obtain in practice.
